# Node exporter

>**Note:**
Available since Omnibus GitLab 8.16. For installations from source you'll
have to install and configure it yourself.

The [node exporter] allows you to measure various machine resources such as
memory, disk and CPU utilization.

To enable the node exporter:

1. [Enable Prometheus](index.md#configuring-prometheus)
1. Edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb`
1. Find and uncomment the following line, making sure it's set to `true`:

    ```ruby
    node_exporter['enable'] = true
    ```

1. Save the file and [reconfigure GitLab][reconfigure] for the changes to
   take effect

Prometheus it will now automatically begin collecting performance data from
the node exporter. You can visit `<your_domain_name>:9100/metrics` for a real
time representation of the metrics that are collected. Refresh the page and
you will see the data change.
