# Merge request reviews

<!-- Maybe add a list of maintainers from the team page, so that people might now who to ping? -->
Once your contribution is ready for review by one of our frontend maintainers, they will post a comment with a checklist into your Merge Request.
This helps the contributor to understand which points are important for the frontend maintainers.
Furthermore the maintainers have it easier to hold everyone responsible to a collective standard rather than individual ones.
You can find the current checklist below:

- - -

*General*

- [ ] The code is styled correctly [(?)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/new_fe_guide/style/index.html)
- [ ] jQuery is only used if necessary [(?)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/development/new_fe_guide/principles.html)

*Vue*

- [ ] Adherence of naming conventions [(?)](http://example.org)
- [ ] VueX Stores are unit tested [(?)](http://example.org)
