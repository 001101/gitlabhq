# Release

Spend less time configuring your tools, and more time creating. Whether you’re
deploying to one server or thousands, build, test, and release your code
confidently and securely with GitLab’s built-in Continuous Delivery and Deployment.

- [Auto Deploy](topics/autodevops/index.md#auto-deploy): Configure GitLab CI for the deployment of your application.
- [Environments and deployments](ci/environments.md): With environments, you can control the continuous deployment of your software within GitLab.
- [GitLab Pages](user/project/pages/index.md): Build, test, and deploy a static site directly from GitLab.
- [Scheduled Pipelines](user/project/pipelines/schedules.md)
- [Protected Runners](ci/runners/README.md#protected-runners)
