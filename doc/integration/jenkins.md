# Jenkins CI integration

GitLab can be configured to interact with Jenkins

Integration includes: 

* Trigger Jenkins build after push to repo
* Show build status on Merge Request page

Requirements: 

* Jenkins GitLab Hook plugin
* git clone access for Jenkins from GitLab repo (via ssh key)

## Jenkins

1. Install GitLab Hook plugin
2. Setup jenkins project

## GitLab


### Read access to repository 

Jenkins need read access to GitLab repository. We already specified private key to use in Jenkins. Now we need to add public key to GitLab project

### Jenkins service

Now navigate to GitLab services page and activate Jenkins

Done! Now when you push to GitLab - it will create a build for Jenkins.
And also you will be able to see merge request build status with a link to the Jenkins build.

## Development

An explanation of how this works in case anyone want to improve it or develop this service for another CI tool.
In GitLab there is no database table that lists the commits, these are always read from the repository.
Therefore it is not possible to mark the build status of a commit in GitLab.
Actually we believe this information should be stored in a single place, the CI tool itself.
To show this information in a merge request you make a project service in GitLab.
This project service does a (JSON) query to a url of the CI tool with the SHA1 of the commit.
The project service builds this url and payload based on project service settings and knowlegde of the CI tool.
The response is parsed to give a response in GitLab (success/failed/pending).
All this happens with AJAX requests on the merge request page.
The Jenkins project service code is only available in GitLab EE.
The GitLab CI project service code is available in the GitLab CE codebase.
In GitLab 6.9 there is a small difference between GitLab CE and EE regarding project services, but this should be gone in 7.0.
