# Deploy Boards

> [Introduced][ce-1589] in [GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium][ee] 9.0.

GitLab's Deploy Boards offer a consolidated view of the current health and
status of each CI [environment] running on [Kubernetes], displaying the status
of the pods in the deployment. Developers and other teammates can view the
progress and status of a rollout, pod by pod, in the workflow they already use
without any need to access Kubernetes.

## Overview

With Deploy Boards you can gain more insight into deploys with benefits such as:

- Following a deploy from the start, not just when it's done
- Watching the rollout of a build across multiple servers
- Finer state detail (Waiting, Deploying, Finished, Unknown)

Since Deploy Boards are tightly coupled with Kubernetes, there is some required
knowledge. In particular you should be familiar with:

- [Kubernetes pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods)
- [Kubernetes labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)

Here's an example of a Deploy Board of the production environment.

The squares represent pods in your Kubernetes cluster that are associated with
the given environment. Hovering above each square you can see the state of a
deploy rolling out. The percentage is the percent of the pods that are updated
to the latest release.

## Deploy Board requirements

In order to gather the deployment status you need to label your deployments,
replica sets and pods with the `app` key and use the `CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG` as
a value. Each project will need to have a unique namespace in Kubernetes as well.

The complete requirements for Deploy Boards to display for a specific [environment] are:

1. You should have a Kubernetes cluster up and running
1. Configure the [Kubernetes service][kube-service] in your project for the cluster.
1. GitLab Runner should be configured with the [Docker][docker-exec] or
   [Kubernetes][kube-exec] executor
1. Use the Kubernetes labels and label your deployments `app=$CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG`
   in the unique namespace specified in the Kubernetes service setting. GitLab has a
   [Kubernetes deployment example](#using-the-kubernetes-deploy-example-project)
   which can simplify the build and deployment process.
1. Optionally, use an [Autodeploy] `.gitlab-ci.yml`
   template which has predefined stages and commands to use.

Once all of the above are set up and the pipeline has run at least once,
navigate to the environments page under **Pipelines âž” Environments**. GitLab
will query Kubernetes for the state of each node (e.g., spinning up, down,
running version A, running version B) and the Deploy Board status will be displayed on
the environments page.

Bare in mind that Deploy Boards are collapsed under their respective environment,
but can be expanded. Only top-level environments are expanded by default. So if
you use `review/*` for [review apps], the Deploy Boards will appear collapsed initially.

## Using the Kubernetes deploy example project

The [kubernetes-deploy][kube-deploy] project is used to simplify the deployment
process to Kubernetes by providing the `build`, `deploy` and `destroy` commands
which you can use in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` as-is.

Another simple example would be the deployment of Nginx on Kubernetes.
Consider a `nginx-deployment.yaml` file in your project with contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: __CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG__
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.7.9
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

The important part is where we set up `app: __CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG__`. As you'll
see later this is replaced by the [`CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG` env variable][variables].

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` would be:

```yaml
image: registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/kubernetes-deploy

kubernetes deploy:
  stage:
    - deploy
  environment:
    name: $CI_BUILD_REF_NAME
  script:
    - echo "$KUBE_CA_PEM" > kube_ca.pem
    - cat kube_ca.pem
    - kubectl config set-cluster default-cluster --server=$KUBE_URL --certificate-authority="$(pwd)/kube_ca.pem"
    - kubectl config set-credentials default-admin --token=$KUBE_TOKEN
    - kubectl config set-context default-system --cluster=default-cluster --user=default-admin --namespace $KUBE_NAMESPACE
    - kubectl config use-context default-system

    - sed -i "s/__CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG__/$CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG/" nginx-deployment.yaml
    - cat nginx-deployment.yaml
    - kubectl cluster-info
    - kubectl get deployments -l app=$CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG
    - kubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yaml || kubectl replace -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

Notice that we use a couple of environment Kubernetes variables to configure
the Kubernetes cluster. These are exposed from the
[Kubernetes service](integrations/kubernetes.md#deployment-variables).

Next, we replace `__CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG__` with the content of the
`CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG` variable, so that the `app` label has the correct value.

Finally, the Nginx pod is created from the definition of the
`nginx-deployment.yaml` file.
