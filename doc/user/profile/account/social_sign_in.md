# Connect other social accounts to GitLab

GitLab can use the OAuth protocol to authenticate using other providers. That
means that if a [provider is enabled][providers] in your GitLab instance, you
will be able to use the credentials from that provider to sign in to GitLab.

## Connecting a social account

Navigate to your **Profile > Account** (`/profile/account`) and you can see what
providers you are able to connect with.
