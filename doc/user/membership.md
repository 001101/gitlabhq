# User membership to projects and groups

GitLab's [permission model][permissions] allows users to have different
abilities depending on the access level they have in a particular group or
project. You can manage the groups and users and their access levels in all of
your projects as well as personalize the access level you give each user,
per-project.

To manage the membership of project users you need at least Master
permission, whereas for groups you need to be an Owner.

The first step to add or import a user, go to your project and click on
**Members** in the drop-down menu on the right side of your screen.

## Invite users using their email address

If a user you want to give access to doesn't have an account on your GitLab
instance, you can invite them just by typing their email address in the user
search field.

## Request access to a project or a group

As a project owner you can enable or disable non members to request access to
your project and as a user you can request to be a member of a project.
