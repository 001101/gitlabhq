# Add a user to a project

Right next to **People**, start typing the name or username of the user you
want to add.

Select the user and the [permission level](../../user/permissions.md)
that you'd like to give the user. Note that you can select more than one user.

Once done, hit **Add users to project** and they will be immediately added to
your project with the permissions you gave them above.

From there on, you can either remove an existing user or change their access
level to the project.
