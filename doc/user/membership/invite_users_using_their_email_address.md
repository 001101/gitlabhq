## Invite people using their email address

If a user you want to give access to doesn't have an account on your GitLab
instance, you can invite them just by typing their e-mail address in the
user search field.

As you can imagine, you can mix inviting multiple people and adding existing
GitLab users to the project.

Once done, hit **Add users to project** and watch that there is a new member
with the e-mail address we used above. From there on, you can resend the
invitation, change their access level or even delete them.

Once the user accepts the invitation, they will be prompted to create a new
GitLab account using the same e-mail address the invitation was sent to.
