You can turn any git tag into release by just adding a release notes to it. 
Release notes behaves like any other markdown form in GitLab so you can write text and drag-n-drop files to it.
Release notes are stored in GitLab database. 

There are several ways to add release notes: 

* In UI when you create new git tag with GitLab
* In UI when you add release notes to existing git tag
* with GitLab API
