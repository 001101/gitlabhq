# Issue Weight

When you have a lot of issues, it can be hard to get an overview.
By adding a weight to each issue, you can get a better idea of how much time,
value or complexity a given issue has or will cost.

To set the weight of issue, simply change the value in the dropdown menu.
You can set it to a numeric value from 1 to 9.

This value will appear on issues, in the list of issues and you can see the 
total sum of all issues on the milestone page.
