# Project Users and Members

You can add or import members to your projects. You can also give them different access
levels.

You should have 'master' or 'owner' permissions to add or import a new member to your 
project.

To add or import a new member, go to your project and click on "Members" on the left side
of your screen:

Select "Add members" or "Import members" on the right side of your screen:

If you are adding a member, select the user and the [permission level](doc/permissions/permissions.md) that you'd like to
give the member:
