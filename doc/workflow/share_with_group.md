# Sharing a project with a group

If you want to share a single project in a group with another group,
you can do so easily. By setting the permission you can quickly
give a select group of users access to a project in a restricted manner.

In a project go to the project settings -> groups.

Now you can select a group that you want to share this project with and with
which access level. Users in that group are able to access this project
with the set access level.
