# Contribution Analytics (EE only)

In order to make it easy to see how and where are active in your projects,
weâ€™re building contribution analytics for GitLab Enterprise Edition.

In GitLab 8.3, you can now quickly get an overview of activity of a group by going to **Group -> Contribution Analytics** at `/groups/groupname/analytics`.
