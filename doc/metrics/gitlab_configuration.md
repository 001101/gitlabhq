# GitLab Configuration

By default GitLab Metrics is disabled. To enable GitLab Metrics and change any
of its settings open a web browser and navigate to
`http://YOUR_GITLAB_HOST/admin/application_settings`, the settings can be found
in the "Metrics" section. A restart of all GitLab processes is required for any
changes to take effect.

## Pending Migrations

When any migrations are pending the metrics are disabled until the migrations
have been performed.
