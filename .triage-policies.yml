            Hi,

            First of all, thank you for raising an issue to help improve the GitLab product. We're sorry about this, but this particular issue has gone unnoticed for quite some time. To establish order in the GitLab-CE Issue Tracker, we must ensure that every issue is correctly labelled and triaged, to get the proper attention.

            This issue will be closed, as it meets the following criteria:
            * No activity in the past 12 months
            * No milestone (unscheduled)

            We'd like to ask you to help us out and determine whether this issue should be reopened.

            If this issue is reporting a bug, please can you attempt to reproduce on the latest version of GitLab or GitLab.com, to help us to understand whether the bug still needs our attention.

            If this issue is proposing a new feature, please can you verify whether the feature proposal is still relevant.

            Thanks for your help

            * Open
            * Labelled ~"Community Contribution"
            * No activity in the past 6 months

            We'd like to ask you to help us out and let us know whether:

            * You would like us to take on the Merge Request for you
            * You would like us to close down the Merge Request

            Thanks for your help
