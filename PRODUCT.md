# Product

At GitLab, we introduce changes in small, rapid iterations. Changes should never take away from the experience of the end user or introduce extra steps in workflows.

## What to suggest

GitLab wants to bring your products _frictionless from idea to production_. This means that _anyone_ involved with the lifecycle of a product should be able to use GitLab _and do so happily_.

### Minimally Viable Proposal

It’s great to have big ideas, but big ideas are hard to tackle at once. That’s why we expect you to write a minimally viable proposal.

A MVP is a proposal for a change in its very simplest form. Starting simple means we can iterate based on our experience and feedback from others. It also means we can build almost anything with a single release.

### No options!

Your proposal should not introduce options. Options increase code, product complexity. They make GitLab harder to use, unfriendlier to new _and_ returning users and harder to contribute to.

Don’t introduce options.

## Writing Issues

At GitLab, everything starts with an issue. Anyone can and should create issues. When creating or editing an issue, it is your job to shape this into a form that is understandable for everyone.

Use the template below to bring any issue into shape. If you’re editing an existing issue, it is a good idea to keep the original contents below.

```
## Description including problem, use cases, benefits, and/or goals

## Proposal

## Links / references
```

It is imperative that you keep the word count as low as possible. Don’t diverge, don’t ramble. People tend to not read anything more than a handful of sentences.

Adding drawings, mockups, sketches is encouraged.

Any engineer familiar with GitLab should be able to get to work based on your issue. It’s fine to leave some details to the engineer to solve, but work out anything that you think can be a problem.

## The issue body is the single source of truth

Whenever changes are made to the planned change, make sure that the issue body reflects these changes, it is the single source of truth.

An engineer working on an issue is not expected to first read through a long comment thread before having to start.

## Scheduling issues

Scheduling issues happens according to milestones. This has to be done in close collaboration with engineering.

## Labels

Issues should have relevant labels applied. For most changes, this would be
~"feature proposal". See [PROCESS](PROCESS.md) for more details.
