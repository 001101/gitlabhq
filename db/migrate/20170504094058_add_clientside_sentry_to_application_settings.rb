  # When using the methods "add_concurrent_index", "remove_concurrent_index" or
  # "add_column_with_default" you must disable the use of transactions
  # as these methods can not run in an existing transaction.
  # When using "add_concurrent_index" or "remove_concurrent_index" methods make sure
  # that either of them is the _only_ method called in the migration,
  # any other changes should go in a separate migration.

  # and can be retried or reverted easily.

  # Reversability was tested when I made an update the originally irreversible
  # migration after I ran it, so I could test that the down method worked and then
  # the up method worked.
