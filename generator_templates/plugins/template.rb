# Requirements
# * File name must end with _s.rb. For example, jenkins_plugin.rb.
# * All code should be inside class. No code should be executed on file load.
# * Class name must be same as file name.
#   If file name is jenkins_plugin.rb then class name must be JenkinsPlugin.
#
# Reccomendations
# * Code should not depend on or use GitLab classes and other code.
# * Consider contributing your plugin to GitLab source code so we can test it
#   and make sure it will work in further version.
