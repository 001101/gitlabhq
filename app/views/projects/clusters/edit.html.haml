-# Even if we got an error during the creation process, we don't delete cluster objects automatically, because we don't have a method to delete the cluster on gke. So users move to edit page from new page **regardless of validation errors**, and they have to delete the record manually. This is for giving users headsup that a new cluster might remain in gke. /cc @ayufan
